# Minimal Obsidian Vault

## Philosophy

- Minimal plugins and options
	- Newbies are always afraid of the learning curve and huge plugins ecosystem of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), but it actually DOES NOT exist
	- I took thousands of notes and tried hundreds of plugins. Finally, I realize that there is no need to install so much 3rd plugins. Only about **10** third-party plugins must be installed, other plugins are unnecessary to write down the thousands of notes, or are extremely simple to use
	- So I create this minimal obsidian vault
